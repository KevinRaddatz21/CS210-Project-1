# CS210-Project-1
Program to create a Dual 12/24 Hr clock that the User can manipulate

The purpose of this project was to create a 12/24 Hour clock to International standard ISO 8601. 
I felt that I did well modularizing my code with creating methods for each piece of functionality. I also feel
I did well on keeping my main as short as possible as well as keeping in-line comments. I felt I could improve on 
keeping my overall code a slight bit neater and easier to follow. I felt it was difficult to get started on the project 
and to manage my time. I also got quite confused at first thinking that the project needed to be a running clock, but it instead just
needed to be able to be manipulated by the user. The project helped me to improve my skills in relation to functions/methods and keeping
things as short and concise as possible. These are skills that will always be applicable in any type of programming. This program was 
made readable, maintainable, and adaptable by keeping things broken down into methods as well as trying to keep it as neat as possible.
